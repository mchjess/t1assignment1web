### 3. Wireframes & Design Rationale

#### Design Process

As I am new to coding websites, I was eager to find an elegant design which matched my current coding skills. I chose a split screen landing page that would feature my latest professional headshot and feature the typography in the navigation bar. My intention was to develop a clean, simple and effective design that was easy to read and navigate and that works across multiple browsers. I chose to use Flickr to host the largest images on the website to keep my files as small as possible.

I took the entire colour palette for the website from this headshot. Using consistent stying elements and colours serves to maintain theme and flow throughout the website. Each page uses the same background colours, font types, sizes and nav positioning (with the exception of the landing page). I chose the mouse over hover colour based on a complementary colour to that of the background. The intention was to evoke warm and nurtured feelings and I carried this blush pink through not only the surprise headshot feature but as the hover colour for all the hyperlinks.

The Developer Page is a placeholder page of sorts which links out to my GitHub profile via the logo image. I have also included a hyperlink to my Hire Me page to encourage site visitors to get in touch with me and to remain on my website for as long as possible. The background colour was chosen from the original headshot image using a palette extractor from Adobe. I then checked that the colour contrasts between text and background worked using the Adobe contrast checker.

The Photoblography page is an opportunity for me to acknowledge that I am actively showcasing my photography as well as the textual content as potential earning opportunities and as a way to demonstrate artistic experience and skill.

I have used the same background and font colours, font families, sizes and positioning to maintain design flow and designed my grid to be responsive so that dimensionality, porportion and readability is maximised across all web devices.

To maximise my potential for contact with a client and/or and employer, I have chosen to showcase my recently published work as a copywriter on a separate page. This is to highlight to an IT employer that it is both a separate field but a related function of web content development. This page includes a link to my Hire Me page where visitors can contact me directly and hyperlinks to the business website I was employed by.

The Hire Me page is the page where potential employers can get in contact with me to hire me. I have included some textual content related to my professional and personal development as well as links to the professional clients I have worked for in the past. 

My LinkedIn and GitHub profile links are prominiently placed in the header to help the visitor understand that this page is where they decide to hire me for their project.

I have included logos to help clients and visitors visualise the association and to build reputational trust. The fields in the contact me form is responsive and sizeable for the visitor. They can download a PDF copy of my CV from this page.

### 5. Target Audience

The target audience for this website is IT professionals and clients looking for a web developer/designer. I am trying to attract paid employment for work similar to what I have demonstrated I am capable of.

### 6. Tech Stack

This website portfolio was coded from scratch by me using semantic HTML5 elements and responsive CSS styling. Code was copied only from tutorial websites when looking for a specific design element I had already chosen such as a responsive box for blog posts, etc. All styling, fonts, colours and photographs are created and owned by me or else freeware.  

The CSS and HTML coding for this website is located in [this repo](https://github.com/mchjess/t1assignment1web). 

The website was deployed using Netlify and can be [found here](https://main--jessmchenrywebportfolio.netlify.app/).
