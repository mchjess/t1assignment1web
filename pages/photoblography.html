            <h3>STEAM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.</h3>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.mca.com.au/">museum of contemporary art (MCA)</a> has made available a range of exhaustive teaching and learning resources on their website. Their commitment to recognising Art as part of our essential skills learning saw them create a learning platform with a set of values that sum up my own pretty nicely: 
            <li>to accept that everything is connected </li>
            <li>to conduct oneself with responsibility and respect</li> 
            <li>embrace the unknown</li> 
            <li>to recognise knowledge from everyone and everything</li>
            <li>to communicate in the many languages of STEAM and to acknowledge the role of emotions.</li>

        <p>Recently relocating from Brighton, Victoria, to country NSW hasn't been quite the culture-shock that you'd imagine.  It's not uncommon to hear very broad rural accents throughout Melbourne. Having been raised not just in Sydney but in some very culturally influential parts of Sydney where Italian and Greek immigrant families predominately lived meant that I grew up speaking with a thick European-style accent that mimicked a lot of my friends. A fellow student, Korean-born Harry Kim, had a very similar accent at the end of his first year at my primary school.</p>
