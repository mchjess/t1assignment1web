            <h3>STEAM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.</h3>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.mca.com.au/">museum of contemporary art (MCA)</a> has made available a range of exhaustive teaching and learning resources on their website. Their commitment to recognising Art as part of our essential skills learning saw them create a learning platform with a set of values that sum up my own pretty nicely: 
            <li>to accept that everything is connected </li>
            <li>to conduct oneself with responsibility and respect</li> 
            <li>embrace the unknown</li> 
            <li>to recognise knowledge from everyone and everything</li>
            <li>to communicate in the many languages of STEAM and to acknowledge the role of emotions.</li>

        <h4>Date: Wednesday, 22nd May 2024</h4>
        I was raised in some very culturally influential parts of Sydney where Italian and Greek immigrant families predominately lived. I grew up speaking with a thick European-style accent that mimicked a lot of my friends'. A fellow student, Korean-born Harry, had a very similar accent at the end of his first year at my primary school.</p>
        <p>
        The sounds of a place are either the most comforting or least comforting aspects of a space. Too noisy and I can't focus on anything but the interruptions. I don't think I've found somewhere too quiet. Which is strange because I used to fear losing my hearing.
        </p>
        <p>The dream is a giant manor house on a ridiculous amount of acres within walking distance of a private beach visited only by friendly wildlife that don't eat swimmers. It use to be a dream of me alone with chosen pets. Now I long to fill those rooms with the sounds of my own disordered and chaotic family.</p>
