            <h3>STEAM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.</h3>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.mca.com.au/">museum of contemporary art (MCA)</a> has made available a range of exhaustive teaching and learning resources on their website. Their commitment to recognising Art as part of our essential skills learning saw them create a learning platform with a set of values that sum up my own pretty nicely: 
            <li>to accept that everything is connected </li>
            <li>to conduct oneself with responsibility and respect</li> 
            <li>embrace the unknown</li> 
            <li>to recognise knowledge from everyone and everything</li>
            <li>to communicate in the many languages of STEAM and to acknowledge the role of emotions.</li>

        <h4>Date: Wednesday, 22nd May 2024</h4>
        I was raised in some very culturally influential parts of Sydney where Italian and Greek immigrant families predominately lived. I grew up speaking with a thick European-style accent that mimicked a lot of my friends'. A fellow student, Korean-born Harry, had a very similar accent at the end of his first year at my primary school.</p>
        <p>
        The sounds of a place are either the most comforting or least comforting aspects of a space. Too noisy and I can't focus on anything but the interruptions. I don't think I've found somewhere too quiet. Which is strange because I used to fear losing my hearing.
        </p>
        <p>The dream is a giant manor house on a ridiculous amount of acres within walking distance of a private beach visited only by friendly wildlife that don't eat swimmers. It used to be a dream of me alone with chosen pets. Now I long to fill those rooms with the sounds of my own disordered and chaotic human family too.</p>

    <p>Lost pieces of self can feel so unfamiliar and strange when they come back (or you rediscover them or however which way the process works). They can even speak different languages when they come back.
    <p>
     Not being able to understand yourself is the cruellest torment.

    <h4>Date: Tuesday, 21st May 2024</h4>
    <p>
        When I was little I used to enjoy prising off palm-sized sheafs of tree bark from almost any tree I could. Paperbark trees were the favourite for a while. Gumtrees could be satisfying if you got your hands around a curly bit the tree was already getting rid of.
        <p>
            Trees aren't people so you can just walk up to a trunk you've never seen before and begin disfiguring it any way you like. As long as you're not intentionally destructive. Unintentional destruction is so much harder to police.
            <p>
                When a layer of tree bark comes off in my hands the first thing I do is run my fingers over the silk-smooth trunk beneath. 
            </p> 
            <p>I was walking through a dog park I used to visit every morning and sometimes up to three times a day when I took this photo with my phone. It was tree bark I couldn't get my nails under. I couldn't prise it off and run my fingers over the smooth new bark beneath. The eight year old part of me that I will always be was so disappointed and that sharp twang of childish tantrum brought me up short. Where else was that emotion? It didn't feel unfamiliar or new or different at all. It felt well worn. Like a comfortable jacket that I might already have been wearing.
                <p>
                    Adult me has trouble dealing with disappointment, apparently.
