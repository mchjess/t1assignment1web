            <h3>STEAM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.</h3>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.mca.com.au/">museum of contemporary art (MCA) </a>has made available a range of exhaustive teaching and learning resources on their website. Their commitment to recognising Art as part of our essential skills learning saw them create a learning platform with a set of values that sum up my own pretty nicely: to accept that everything is connected, to conduct oneself with responsibility and respect, to embrace the unknown, to recognise knowledge from everyone and everything, to communicate in the many languages of STEAM and to acknowledge the role of emotions.</p>
