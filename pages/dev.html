            <h3>IN THE MEAN TIME, I'M CONCENTRATING ON DEVELOPING MY DESIGN SKILLS AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE WORLD OF PROGRAMMING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.</h3>
            <p>
                I have a GitHub profile that I'd love to share with you. Here is where you'll find my professional and academic projects alongside personal designs that show off what I can think up when I'm left to my own devices.
            </p>
        <p>If you have any suggestions to help me develop further as a designer and a developer then please get in touch with me. By following this link you can read a bit more about my professional experience, download a copy of my CV and send me a quick message about a project you'd like me to collaborate with you on.</p>
        <p>
            I'm really looking forward to developing. *snerk*
