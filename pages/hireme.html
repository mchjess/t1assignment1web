           <h4>Professional Skills & Development</h4>
           <p>
            I'm a Creative All-Rounder. I have qualifications in Writing, Art Therapy, Acting for Stage & Screen, and I'm currently studying a Diploma of IT (Web Development Boot Camp) to formally consolidate my self-taught design and coding skills. I use Kanban project management tools and Trello to manage workload and provide my clients with full transparency.
            <p> 
            <h4>Experience</h4>
           </p>
                <p> 
                    My career started in Procurement and Contracts Management working first in the medical industry with Synthes and Johnson&Johnson before transitioning into the construction industry with Boral Ltd. </p>
                    <p>
                        Wild Light Arts is the freelance company I developed in April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic while I was living in Melbourne. Through WLA, I have worked on campaigns for Australian Defence contracts on behalf of the <a href="https://www.chisholm.edu.au/">Chisholm Institute (VIC TAFE)</a>, for top international brands including <a href="https://www.miele.com.au/">Miele</a> and <a href="https://www.proactiv.com/">Proactiv</a>, and for local communities including the <a href="https://www.sandybeach.org.au/">Sandy Beach Centre</a> and the NFP <a href="https://www.songroom.org.au/">The Songroom</a> on behalf of Victorian Government's <a href="https://arc.educationapps.vic.gov.au/event/4466"> Kaleidoscope Initiative.</a></p>     
                    <h4>Personal Development</h4>
                    <p>
                    Over the pandemic, I studied a Diploma of Art Therapy while I rehabbed from a back injury. This has helped me round out my communication skills and I can confidently drive story and design from a human-centered UI POV which I am actively developing in my coding bootcamp studies.</p>
                    <p>
                    In my downtime, I love SUP-ing, bushwalking with my dog, reading and pretty much anything related to the Arts and world of art-making. I have a passionate life outside my work which keeps me alert, inspired and grounded within my work.</p>
